            <h1>Brief History of UIP</h1>
            <p>The <b>University of Ilocos Philippines formerly known as (ISPSC)</b> was created by virtue of RA 8547 authored by the then Congressman of the 2nd District of Ilocos Sur, Hon. Eric D. Singson converting the then Ilocos Sur Polytechnic College (ISPC) into a state college. The charter was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 24, 1998. The then Ilocos Sur Polytechnic College was created by virtue of RA 7960 also authored by then Congressman Eric D. Singson and signed into law on March 29, 1995. The law converted the then Ilocos Sur Agricultural College (ISAC) into a polytechnic college integrating into it seven vocational-technical and general academic secondary schools in the second district of Ilocos Sur namely: Narvacan School of Fisheries NASOF), Southern Ilocos Sur School of Fisheries (SISSOF), Ilocos Sur Experimental Station and Pilot School of Cottage Industries (ISESPSCI), Tagudin General Comprehensive High School (TGCHS), Cervantes National Agro-Industrial School (CNAIS), Suyo National High School and Salcedo National High School. After its conversion into a state college, two of the campuses, Suyo Campus and Salcedo Campus, were reverted back to the Department of Education.</p>
